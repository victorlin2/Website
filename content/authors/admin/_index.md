Xiangping Lin, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University. He received his Ph.D. in chemistry from Sorbonne Paris North University, France. Dr. Lin’s research is centered on analytical chemistry, with a particular focus on mass spectrometry and NMR-based omics studies. His work spans a range of fields, including metabolomics, exposomics, lipidomics, and their applications in biomedical and environmental research. In addition, he has extensive experience in multivariate statistics (PCA, PLS-DA, et cetera.), variable selection (logistic regression, LASSO regression, et cetera.), and R programming.
